# AutoEnvForge
A robust one-click tool that automatically detects and sets up development environments for any GitHub repository. It scans code, infers dependencies, generates reproducible setups (e.g., Dockerfiles, virtualenvs), and handles edge cases like multi-language repos or legacy code, reducing setup time from hours to minutes.
